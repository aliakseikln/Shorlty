# Libraries and technologies used:
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert reponse json file to Kotlin/Java object.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) : Save in local database.
- [MVVM & LiveData](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) -Background code execution.
- [View binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) : Instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) : Dependency injection.
