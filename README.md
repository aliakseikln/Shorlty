# Libraries and technologies used.
- Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert reponse json file to Kotlin/Java object.
- Room : Save meals in local database.
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- Coroutines : do some code in the background.
- view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- Koin : dependency injection.
