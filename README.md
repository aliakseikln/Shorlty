# Shorlty
Shorten your long links just copy and paste them into the field and confirm the action! And then they will be displayed in your history list but already shortened and they can be copied to anyone in one click!

## Case Study:
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)
  - Dependency injection in the project.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) 
  - REST client for Java and Android. It makes it easy to get and load JSON.

# Libraries and technologies used:
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert reponse json file to Kotlin/Java object.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) : Save in local database.
- [MVVM & LiveData](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) -Background code execution.
- [View binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) : Instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) : Dependency injection.
